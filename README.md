# UiComponents Breakout

This is a small example module showing how to manage slightly more complex interdependent shared view state with Magento UiComponents.

It uses a simple version of the 80s arcade game Breakout as a scenario.

I think UiComponents where not designed to be used in this manner, but it works as a demo for external state management.  

This module was created written as an example for my presentation at MageTitansIT 2018 in Milano.
